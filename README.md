# gradient_ascent_descent
Gradient ascent/descent is a method used for optimization and has a lot of different applications. It is very prominent in machine learning where it is used to optimize the parameters of a neural network. Gradient ascent can be compared to climbing a mountain and reaching eats peak while taking the steepest route possible. The methods for ascent and descent only differ in the direction of the steps made. For ascent the steps are taken towards the summit (in the direction of the gradient) and for descent the steps are made towards the valley (in the opposite direction of the gradient).
